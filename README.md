## Transmission Screensaver

The theme behind this screensaver was based off all those high-tech hacking displays from movies and television. It is not really going for a real look but more asthetics. Good base for any screensaver someone would want to create in C#.

Old project from High School.


### Features

- Random Background Colors for each screen
- Ability to add new screens with ease
- Bell Curve Screen Transition Sweeps
- Modifiable List of Background Colors
- Use of custom fonts (needs work to not force install of all fonts)
