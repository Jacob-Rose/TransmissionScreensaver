Transmission Screensaver Notes

New Screens:
	-3d wireframe globe

Redesign Screens:
- Clock:
	add unique UI instead of actual numbers, using possibly many systems below
		timerExample
		dot system: 2x6 dots for hours then a 10x6 grid for minutes and 10x6 grid for seconds with hour, min, and second dots having different colors


- Terminal
	code has a certain chance or after random time moves to next line, making the randomstring movedown slowly and the indicator label move down and a new label is created above with the randomstring that was there before

Other Notes:
	- add some background effects to screens, such as random letters flying past
	- redesign timer system and have certain systems going for more times (elements can move at different speeds or dont need to be updated as often)
	- possibly port to WPF or some other system.
